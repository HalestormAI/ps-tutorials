# Photometric Stereo Tutorial 1 - The Basics

This directory contains a single example using 3-light photometric stereo to calculate the surface normal vector field.

Example data can be found in the [Demo Images directory](../demo-images).

Install the dependencies using the requirements file in the parent directory, as described in the main README.

You can then run this example by simply calling:

```python
    $ python3 psbasics.py
```
