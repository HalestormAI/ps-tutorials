# Photometric Stereo Tutorial Code
This code is set up to follow roughly with the series of [Photometric Stereo tutorials](http://www.ian-hales.com/tag/photometric-stereo-tutorial-series/) on my website.

It's all written in Python 3, using with heavy use of Numpy and Matplotlib and SciPy. 

Dependencies can be installed using pip by running;

```bash
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Example images can be found in the demo-images folder.
